Hi!  Thanks from dropping by!

I hope you find the information in this blog useful.  My purpose in creating it was to share with you my experiences as I work to become a Swift/iOS developer.  I've just started on this path so necessarily, the informtion you find here will be most useful for beginners, initially.  As I grow and learn, I will continue to share everything I had a great deal of trouble understanding and I will always try to explain such concepts in the simplest way I can.

Now, a bit more information about me will clarify some questions you may have if you're planning on visiting often - I'm not a total beginner when it comes to programming.  Given this, you won't find very basic info about the Swift programming language, for instance, how loops work, or conditional statements.  But, if you're stuck on something basic, let me know and I'll do my best to explain in an easy to understand way, creating a post just for that.
